        Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a
 sheet pan with parchment paper. Draw a 9 inch circle on the
 parchment. An easy way to do this is to draw around the
 outside of a 9 inch pan with a pencil.

 In a large bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks
 form. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar gradually, while continuing to
whip. Make sure sugar is completely dissolved. Mix together the
 remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the cornstarch; lightly fold into
 meringue with lemon juice.


 Spread a layer of meringue to fit a circle on parchment,
 approximately 1/4 inch thick. With the remainder of mixture, a
 pipe or spoon swirls around the edges to form a shallow bowl
 shape.

 In a large bowl, combine the cream and half a cup of
 confectioners sugar, and whip until thickened. Decorate with
 fruit of your choice; strawberries are excellent.
