    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <ol>3 Egg whites</ol>
            <ol> 1pinch salt,</ol> 
            <ol>1Cup white sugar,</ol>
            <ol>1tablespoon cornstarch,</ol> 
            <ol>1teaspoon lemon juice</ol> 
    </ul>

    <h3>"Directions"</h3>

    <hr> 

    <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a
 sheet pan with parchment paper. Draw a 9 inch circle on the
 parchment. An easy way to do this is to draw around the
 outside of a 9 inch pan with a pencil.</li>

<li>In a large bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks
    form. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar gradually, while continuing to
   whip. Make sure sugar is completely dissolved. Mix together the
    remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the cornstarch; lightly fold into
    meringue with lemon juice.</li>
 
 <li>Spread a layer of meringue to fit a circle on parchment,
    approximately 1/4 inch thick. With the remainder of mixture, a
    pipe or spoon swirls around the edges to form a shallow bowl
    shape.</li>

 <li>a large bowl, combine the cream and half a cup of
    confectioners sugar, and whip until thickened. Decorate with
    fruit of your choice; strawberries are excellent.</li>
